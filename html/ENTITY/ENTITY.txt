Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  `) and acute (  ´) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

Here are some examples:

Mark	Character	Construct	Result
 `	a	a&#768;	a`
 ´	a	a&#769;	a´
^	a	a&#770;	a^
 ~	a	a&#771;	a~
 `	O	O&#768;	O`
 ´	O	O&#769;	O´
^	O	O&#770;	O^
 ~	O	O&#771;	O~
